Traverse a binary 2D-grid that wraps around the _x_-axis. The same move is done on each iteration.

#### Day 5                                                                                                                                                                                                           
###### Problem
Binary partitioning with 7 and 3 bits
###### Solution
Convert each input string to a 10-bit number. The 7 leading bits (seat row) span a space of 128 values, the 3 last (seat column) span a space of 8 values. The seat ID is given by multiplying row number with 8 and adding the column number. When converting the input to a 10-bit number, the row number bits are automatically left-shifted by 3, the same as mulitplying with 8.

#### Day 6
###### Problem
Union and intersection of chars
###### Solution
Trivial when using a hashset. The [Iterator::fold_first ](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.fold_first) function uses the first element in the iterator as the initial value, which is neat when e.g. intersecting an array of hashsets.

#### Day 7 â€“ The Shiny Gold :sparkling_heart: :yellow_heart:
###### Problem
Directed acyclic graph (DAG)
###### Solution
This is a graph that can be topologically ordered, there are noe loops. Part 1 asks for all possible routes leading to a particular node (The Shiny Gold). This is solved with BFS sort. Part 2 asks for all nodes reachable from a particular starting node (The Shiny Gold). This is solved with DFS sort.
